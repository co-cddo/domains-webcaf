## The CAF - A tool for assessing cyber resilience

The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) provides a systematic and comprehensive approach to assessing the extent to which cyber risks to essential function(s) are being managed by the organisation responsible. CAF-based assessments can be carried out either by the responsible organisation itself (self-assessment) or by an independent external entity, possibly a regulator / cyber oversight body or a suitably qualified organisation acting on behalf of a regulator, such as an NCSC assured commercial service provider.

The NCSC CAF cyber security and resilience objective and principles provide the foundations of the CAF. The 4 high-level objectives and the 14 principles are written in terms of outcomes, i.e. specification of what needs to be achieved rather than a checklist of what needs to be done. The CAF adds additional levels of detail to the top-level principles, including a collection of structured sets of Indicators of Good Practice (IGPs) as described in more detail below.

It should be noted that NCSC developed the CAF in its role as national technical authority for cyber security, with an expectation that it would be used, amongst other things, as a tool to support effective cyber regulation. NCSC itself has no regulatory responsibilities, and organisations subject to cyber regulation should consult with their regulators to learn whether they should use the CAF in the context of meeting regulatory requirements.

## CAF Requirements

The CAF has been developed to meet the following set of requirements:

1. provide a suitable framework to assist in carrying out cyber resilience assessments.
2. maintain the outcome-focused approach of the NCSC cyber security and resilience principles and discourage assessments being carried out as tick-box exercises.
3. be compatible with the use of appropriate existing cyber security guidance and standards.
4. enable the identification of effective cyber security and resilience improvement activities.
5. exist in a common core version which is sector-agnostic.
6. be extensible to accommodate sector-specific elements as may be required.
7. enable the setting of meaningful target security levels for organisations to achieve, possibly reflecting a regulator view of appropriate and proportionate security.
8. be as straightforward and cost-effective to apply as possible.

## CAF Principles and contributing outcomes

Each top-level NCSC security and resilience principle defines a broad cyber security outcome. The precise approach organisations should adopt to achieve each principle is not specified as this will vary according to organisational circumstances. However, each principle can be broken down into a collection of lower-level contributing cyber security and resilience outcomes, all of which will normally need to be achieved to fully satisfy the top-level principle.

An assessment of the extent to which an organisation is meeting a particular principle is accomplished by assessing all the contributing outcomes for that principle. In order to inform assessments at the level of contributing outcomes:

1. each contributing outcome is associated with a set of indicators of good practice (IGPs) and,
2. using the relevant IGPs, the circumstances under which the contributing outcome is judged 'achieved', 'not achieved' or (in some cases) 'partially achieved' are described.

For each contributing outcome the relevant IGPs have conveniently been arranged into table format. The resulting tables, referred to as IGP tables, constitute the basic building blocks of the CAF. In this way, each principle is associated with several tables of IGPs, one table per contributing outcome.

## Using IGPs

Assessment of contributing outcomes is primarily a matter of expert judgement and the IGPs do not remove the requirement for the informed use of cyber security expertise and sector knowledge. IGPs will usually provide good starting points for assessments but should be used flexibly and in conjunction with the NCSC guidance associated with the top-level cyber security and resilience principles. Conclusions about an organisation's cyber security and resilience should only be drawn after considering additional relevant factors and special circumstances.

The 'achieved' (GREEN) column of an IGP table defines the typical characteristics of an organisation fully achieving that outcome. It is intended that all the indicators would normally be present to support an assessment of 'achieved'. The exception would be when an IGP may not be applicable if there are compensating measures that would meet the requirements of the relevant objective.

The 'not achieved' (RED) column of an IGP table defines the typical characteristics of an organisation not achieving that outcome. It is intended that the presence of any one indicator would normally be sufficient to justify an assessment of 'not achieved'.

When present, the 'partially achieved' (AMBER) column of an IGP table defines the typical characteristics of an organisation partially achieving that outcome. It is also important that the partial achievement is delivering specific worthwhile cyber security and resilience benefits. An assessment of 'partially achieved' should represent more than giving credit for doing something vaguely relevant.

The following table summarises the key points relating to the purpose and nature of IGPs.

| IGPs are… | IGPs are not… |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Purpose**: …intended to help inform expert judgement. | …a checklist to be used in an inflexible assessment process. |
| **Scope**: …important examples of what an assessor will normally need to consider, which may need to be supplemented in some cases. | … an exhaustive list covering everything an assessor needs to consider. |
| **Applicability**: …designed to be widely applicable across different organisations, but applicability needs to be established. | …guaranteed to apply verbatim to all organisations. |

## Setting target levels of cyber security and resilience

The result of applying the CAF is 41 individual assessments, each one derived from making a judgement on the extent to which a set of IGPs reflects the circumstances of the organisation being assessed. The CAF has been designed in such a way that a result in which all 41 contributing outcomes were assessed as 'achieved' would indicate a level of cyber security some way beyond the bare minimum 'basic cyber hygiene' level.

A cyber oversight body will need to set target levels of cyber resilience for organisations within their sector. One way of setting these target levels is in relation to the ability to withstand specified categories of cyber attacks (e.g. resilience to basic capability attacks, moderate capability attacks etc.) and the CAF has been designed to support this approach via the idea of CAF profiles.

The NCSC has worked with regulators and other organisations with a cyber resilience oversight role on an approach to interpreting CAF output based on identifying those contributing outcomes considered most important to achieve in order to manage security risks to that organisation's essential functions. Those prioritised contributing outcomes would correspond to an initial view of appropriate and proportionate cyber security for that organisation. The subset of contributing outcomes identified as the most important in this way would represent an example of a CAF profile – something that could be used as the basis for setting a target for organisations to achieve.

In practice a CAF profile consists of a mixture of some contributing outcomes to be met at 'achieved', some at 'partially achieved' and perhaps some (representing cyber security capabilities not appropriate at the level of the profile) identified as 'not applicable'.

It is not the responsibility of the NCSC to mandate what represents appropriate and proportionate cyber security and resilience. Any target set for organisations to achieve in terms of CAF results is for the relevant cyber oversight body to define.

## Making the CAF sector specific

The common core of the CAF (consisting of objectives, principles, contributing outcomes and indicators of good practice) is sector agnostic in the sense that it is designed to be generally applicable to all organisations responsible for essential functions across all key sectors. It is possible that there will be a need for some sector specific aspects of the CAF, which could include the following:

### i) Sector-specific CAF Profiles
Some target profiles may well be sector specific. As mentioned in the section on setting target levels, it will be a decision for the relevant cyber oversight body to put an interpretation on CAF results, which may be from a regulatory perspective.

### ii) Sector-specific Interpretations of Contributing Outcomes/IGPs
It may be necessary in some cases for a sector-specific interpretation of contributing outcomes and/or IGPs to better clarify meaning within the sector.

### iii) Sector-specific Additional Contributing Outcomes/IGPs
There may be circumstances in which sector-specific cyber security requirements cannot be adequately covered by an interpretation of a generic contributing outcome or IGP. In these cases, an additional sector-specific contributing outcome or IGP may need to be defined.

The NCSC will continue to work with the full range of CAF stakeholders to determine if sector-specific aspects of the CAF are required, and to assist in introducing changes as necessary.

# CAF - Objective C – Detecting Cyber Security Events

Capabilities exist to ensure security defences remain effective and to detect cyber security events and incidents adversely affecting, or with the potential to adversely affect, essential function(s).

## Principle C1 Security Monitoring

The organisation monitors the security status of network and information systems supporting the operation of essential function(s) in order to detect security events indicative of a security incident.

### C1.a Sources and Tools for Logging and Monitoring

The data sources and tools that you include in your logging and monitoring allow for timely identification of events which might adversely affect the security or resiliency of network and information system(s) supporting the operation of your essential function(s).

| Not Achieved | Partially Achieved | Achieved |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| At least one of the following statements is true | All the following statements are true | All the following statements are true |
| Data relating to the security and operation of network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) is not collected. | Data relating to the security and operation of some areas of network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) is collected but coverage is not comprehensive. | Monitoring is based on a thorough understanding of network and information systems supporting your essential function(s), techniques used by threat actors, and awareness of what logging and monitoring is required to detect events and incidents that could affect the operation of your essential function(s). |
| You are not able to audit the activities of users and systems in relation to network and information systems supporting your essential function(s). | Some user and system monitoring is done, but not covering a fully agreed list of suspicious or undesirable behaviour. | Your monitoring data provides enough detail to promptly and reliably detect security events, incidents and support investigations. This is reviewed regularly and after a significant security event. |
| You do not monitor traffic crossing your network boundary. | You monitor traffic crossing your network boundary (including IP address connections as a minimum). | Extensive monitoring of user and system activity in relation to network and information systems that support your essential function(s) enables you to promptly detect policy violations, suspicious or undesirable user and system behaviour, deviations from normal / routine behaviour or abnormalities indicative of adverse activity. |
| Log data cannot be synchronised using an accurate common time source. | Some but not all log datasets can be easily queried with search tools to aid in investigations. | Your logging and monitoring capability includes host-based and network monitoring. |
| Logs are stored in locations where they are not readily available to authorised users and systems. | Your monitoring tools work with most log data, with some configuration. | All new network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) are considered as potential logging and monitoring data sources to maintain a comprehensive monitoring capability. |
| Your monitoring tools cannot be configured to make use of new log streams as they come online. | Your monitoring tools can make use of log data that would capture all common threats. | Log datasets are synchronised including using an accurate common time source so that separate datasets can be correlated in appropriate ways. |
| Your monitoring tools are only able to make use of a fraction of the log data being collected. | You ensure log data is available for analysis when needed. | You enrich log data with other network and information systems data to provide a more comprehensive picture of actions and behaviours. |
| You do not understand where log data is stored or how long it should be stored for. |  | Your monitoring tools make use of log data to pinpoint activity. |
| You have no way of ensuring log data is being captured as expected and available when needed. |  | You regularly review the data sources and tools included in your logging and monitoring strategy to ensure it remains effective. |

### C1.b Securing Logs

You hold log data securely and grant appropriate user and system access only to accounts with a business need. Log data is held for a suitable retention period, after which it is deleted.

| Not Achieved | Partially Achieved | Achieved |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| At least one of the following statements is true | All the following statements are true | All the following statements are true |
| It is possible for log data to be easily edited or deleted by unauthorised users / systems or attackers. | Only authorised users and systems can access log data. | Appropriate access to log data is limited to those users and systems with a business need. |
| There is no control of the users and systems that can access log data. | There is some monitoring of access to log data (e.g. copying, deleting or modification, or even viewing). | The logging architecture has mechanisms, policies, processes and procedures to ensure that it can protect itself from threats comparable to those that it is trying to identify. This includes protecting the function itself and the data within it. |
| There is no monitoring of the access to log data. | You have defined and implemented retention periods for log data. | Log data analysis and normalisation is only performed on copies of the log data keeping the master copy unaltered. |
| There are no policies covering access to log data. | You have given legitimate reasons for accessing log data in your policies. | All actions involving log data (e.g. copying, deleting, modification, or even viewing) can be traced back to a unique user or system. |
|  |  | The integrity of log data is protected, verified and any modification, including deletion, is detected and attributed. |

### C1.c Generating Alerts

Evidence of potential security incidents contained in your monitoring data is reliably identified and where appropriate triggers alerts.

| Not Achieved | Partially Achieved | Achieved |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| At least one of the following statements is true | All the following statements are true | All the following statements are true |
| You do not apply updates to your detection security technologies in a timely way, after receiving them (e.g. AV signature updates, other threat signatures or Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)). | You easily detect the presence of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on network and information systems supporting your essential function(s), such as known malicious command and control signatures. | You easily detect the presence of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on network and information systems supporting your essential function(s), such as known malicious command and control signatures, as well as abnormalities or behaviours indicative of adverse activity. |
| Security alerts relating to network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) are not prioritised. | You apply some updates, new signatures and IoCs in a timely way. | You apply all updates, new signatures and IoCs promptly. |
| The enrichment of security alerts within network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) cannot be performed. | Security alerts relating to network and information systems that support your essential function(s) are prioritised. | Security alerts relating to all network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) are prioritised and this information is used to support incident management. |
| You do not confidently detect the presence of IoCs on network and information systems supporting your essential function(s), such as known malicious command and control signatures (e.g. because applying the indicator is difficult or your log data is not sufficiently detailed). | The enrichment of alerts within network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) is performed but not as part of the original alert. | Alerts are routinely enriched within network and information systems supporting your essential function(s). The enrichment of these alerts is performed in almost real time and as part of the original alert. |
| You do not monitor for user or system abnormalities indicative of adverse activity. | Detections and alerting rely on off the shelf tooling without customisation or users reporting events and potential incidents. | Alerts and the underlying detections are regularly reviewed and tested to ensure they are generated promptly and reliably, and it is possible to distinguish genuine security incidents from false alarms. |
| Logs are monitored infrequently. | There is a documented and shared process for all users who support the operation of the essential function to report events and potential security incidents. | Alerts and the underlying detection rules are customisable and tuned to reduce false positives as well as optimising responses. |
|  | Where appropriate, detections and alerting result in automated actions being taken. (e.g. malware identified by AV is quarantined). | Detections and alerting may use off the shelf tooling and rules as well as custom tooling and / or rules. |
|  | You monitor on an irregular basis for user or system abnormalities indicative of adverse activity. | You continuously monitor for user and system abnormalities indicative of adverse activity generating alerts based on the results of such monitoring. |
|  | Logs are monitored at regular intervals. | Logs are monitored continuously in near real time. |

### C1.d Triage of Security Alerts

| You do not triage alerts from your detection security technologies (e.g. AV, IDS). | You investigate and triage alerts from some security tools and take action. | You investigate and triage alerts from all security tools and take action. |
| You do not categorise alerts and incidents by type and priority / severity level. | You have created, made available and use when appropriate, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) / Playbooks / Runbooks covering the most common use cases. These are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain effective. | You have created, made available and use when appropriate, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) / Playbooks / Runbooks covering all plausible use cases. These are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain effective. |
| You do not have Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) / Playbooks / Runbooks available for use during triage. | You perform some triage and actions taken by monitoring and detection personnel are recorded. | You categorise alerts and incidents by type and priority / severity level. |
| You do not keep records of triage performed. | You categorise alerts and incidents by type and priority / severity level. | You document all triage related activities performed by monitoring and detection personnel and these are used to drive improvements |
| You do not have a sufficient understanding of normal user or system behaviour to make effective decisions within triage. | Your understanding of normal user or system behaviour informs your decision making within triage. | Triage provides enough information for subsequent activities to be prioritised (e.g. the containment of damaging malware). |
|  |  | Your understanding of normal user and system behaviour, and threats, is sufficient for effective decision making within triage. |

### C1.e Personnel Skills for Monitoring and Detection

Monitoring and detection personnel skills and roles, including those outsourced, reflect governance and reporting requirements, expected threats and the complexities of the network or system data they need to use. Monitoring and detection personnel have sufficient knowledge of network and information systems and the essential function(s) they need to protect.

| Not Achieved | Partially Achieved | Achieved |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|

| At least one of the following statements is true | All the following statements are true | All the following statements are true |
| Your organisation has no sources of threat intelligence. | You know how effective your threat intelligence is (e.g. by tracking how threat intelligence helps you identify security incidents). | You track the effectiveness of your threat intelligence and actively share feedback on the usefulness of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and other intelligence with the threat community (e.g. sector partners, threat intelligence providers, government agencies). |
| You do not evaluate the usefulness of your threat intelligence or share feedback with providers or other users. | Your organisation may use threat intelligence services, but you do not necessarily choose sources or providers specifically because of your business needs, or specific threats in your sector (e.g. sector-based infoshare, software vendors, anti-virus providers, specialist threat intel firms, special interest groups). | When using threat intelligence feeds, these have been selected using risk-based and threat-informed decisions based on your business needs and sector. |
| You have no awareness of the steps necessary to make best use of threat intelligence for security monitoring. | The user and system abnormalities from past attacks and threat intelligence, on your and other network and information systems, are used to signify adverse activity. | You make relevant, reliable and actionable threat intelligence available to the necessary users and systems promptly. |
| Threat intelligence is unreliable and / or is not actioned by the appropriate users or systems in a timely manner. | You receive regular updates for all of your detection security technologies (e.g. AV, IDS). | You contextualise threat intelligence and link it to the why and / or how attacks take place for security monitoring. |
| You have no established understanding of what abnormalities to look for that might signify adverse activities. | You understand normal user and system abnormalities fully, to such an extent that searching for system abnormalities is an effective way of detecting adverse activity (e.g. you fully understand which systems should and should not communicate and when). | The user and system abnormalities you monitor for are based on the nature of adverse activities likely to impact network and information systems supporting the operation of your essential function(s). |
| You do not receive updates for all your detection security technologies (e.g. AV, IDS). |  | The user and system abnormalities indicative of adverse activity you use are regularly updated to reflect changes in network and information systems supporting your essential function(s) and current threat intelligence. |
| You do not understand normal user and system behaviour sufficiently to be able to use abnormalities to detect adverse activity. |  | You possess the capability to share threat intelligence (e.g. ways to effectively detect adversaries) with the threat community / defender community (sector partners, threat intelligence providers, government agencies) when required. |
