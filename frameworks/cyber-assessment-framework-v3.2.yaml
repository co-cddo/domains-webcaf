                  is, or only understand it in vague terms such as "averse" or "cautious".
                18: Organisational structure causes risk decisions to be
                    made in isolation. (e.g. engineering and IT don't

                19: Risk priorities are too vague to make meaningful
                    distinctions between them. (e.g. almost all risks are

                  by decision-makers and are not effectively communicated in a clear
                  and timely manner.
                26: Risk assessments for network and information systems supporting

                431: You are not usually able to resolve incidents to a root cause.
                432: You do not have a formal process for investigating causes.
              partially-achieved: {}
              achieved:
                433: Root cause analysis is conducted routinely as a key part of your
                  lessons learned activities following an incident.
                434: Your root cause analysis is comprehensive, covering organisational
                  process issues, as well as vulnerabilities in your networks, systems
                  or software.
                435: All relevant incident data is made available to the analysis
                  team to perform root cause analysis.

            description: Your organisation uses lessons learned from incidents to
              improve your security measures.
            indicators:
              not-achieved:
                436: Following incidents, lessons learned are not captured or are
                  limited in scope.
                437: Improvements arising from lessons learned following an incident
                  are not implemented or not given sufficient organisational priority.
              partially-achieved: {}
              achieved:
                438: You have a documented incident review process/policy which ensures
                  that lessons learned from each incident are identified, captured,
                  and acted upon.
                439: Lessons learned cover issues with reporting, roles, governance,
                  skills and organisational processes as well as technical aspects
                  of network and information systems.
                440: You use lessons learned to improve security measures, including
                  updating and retesting response plans when necessary.
                441: Security improvements identified as a result of lessons learned
                  are prioritised, with the highest priority improvements completed
                  quickly.
                442: Analysis is fed to senior management and incorporated into risk
                  management and continuous improvement.
