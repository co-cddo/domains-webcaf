# YAML Representation of CAF

The `create-schema.py` script does most of the work involved in creating a YAML representation of the 3.2 CAF from the [NCSC PDF version](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/cyber-assessment-framework-v3.2.pdf). See the comments in the code for the limitations and where manual work was needed.

The script could be improved in many ways but is of no use once manual editing has begun and is kept just for reference.
