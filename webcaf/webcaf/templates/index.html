                Submit a WebCAF self-assessment
            </h1>
            <p>The WebCAF self-assessment allows you to assess your organisation’s critical systems.</p>
            <p>This is stage 3 of GovAssure, the cyber assurance process used to understand the level of cyber
                resilience across government.
            </p>

            <p>WebCAF is based on the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-assessment-framework"
                                         target="_blank">National Cyber Security Centre's Cyber Assurance Framework
