# Purpose: Validate that an organisation user can log in and view a draft WebCAF assessment
# Audience: Test engineers and developers maintaining the WebCAF UI flows
# Scope: UI journey from login -> My account -> Draft assessments -> Draft assessment overview
# Preconditions:
#  - The application must be running and accessible (step: "Given the application is running")
#  - Seed data is created via Background: Organisation, User, Profile, and a started assessment for "System 1"
# Test data used in this file:
#  - Organisation: "Ministry of Agriculture" (type: ministerial-department)
#  - Systems: System 1, System 2, System 3
#  - User: organisation_user@example.gov.uk (role: Organisation user)
#  - Password: "password" (stubbed for test purposes) # pragma: allowlist secret
# Execution notes:
#  - "Think time" steps are used to pace UI actions in slower environments.
#  - DOM assertions rely on specific selectors (e.g., td[data-label], govuk heading classes) â€“ update if templates change.
# Maintenance notes:
#  - Do not change step phrasing unless corresponding step definitions are updated. In particular, keep the
#    exact wording for link-click steps present below as they are bound to existing step definitions.
